# Pythia
Prediction priestess Pythia based on to AI and Blockchain symbioz

## Tl;dr
This project is a web3 approach that connects AI/ML to the Ethereum blockchain to predict events based on unit interactions. It also integrates MetaMask for authentication and uses ERC721 tokens to represent life experiences.

## Introduction

Pythia project leverages blockchain and AI/ML technologies to log and predict events related to various units (e.g., people). The application supports MetaMask authentication, allowing users to connect their wallets, view their data, and receive a token representing their life experience when they connect for the first time.

## Features

- **Unit Event Prediction**: Predict events based on unit options and timestamps.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Store and retrieve events and units from the Ethereum blockchain.
- **MetaMask Authentication**: Connect to MetaMask and interact with smart contracts.
- **ERC721 Token**: Mint and manage tokens representing life experiences.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js and npm
- MetaMask extension installed in your browser
- Ethereum any testnet for local blockchain development

### Install Dependencies

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/avetkhachoyan/Pythia.git
    cd Pythia
    ```

2. Install Python dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Install Node.js dependencies:

    ```sh
    cd static/js
    npm install
    ```

4. Compile the smart contract:

    ```sh
    cd contracts
    truffle compile
    ```

5. Deploy the smart contract:

    ```sh
    truffle migrate --network development
    ```

### Configure Environment

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

    ```ini
    FLASK_APP=web/app.py
    FLASK_ENV=development
    ```

2. Update the contract address and ABI path in `static/js/web3.js`.

## Usage

1. Start the Flask web server:

    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:

    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```

3. Connect your MetaMask wallet and interact with the application.
